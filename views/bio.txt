Qualified as a Journalist, Highbury College Portsmouth

Worked briefly in newspaper journalism before being hired as a professional copywriter for a technical Marketing company called Writing Machine. Stayed there too long for everyone, had worked my way up to Head of Writing at the agency by the time I left.

Talked my way into a job with a startup recruitment company called Practicus.

Did quite well there, was the first consultant ever to write Â£100,000 in a single month.

Became the go-to guy for difficult things: setting up a new desk to cover the retail or pharmaceutical industry.

Was asked to help set up the Australian division of the business. Did so. Moved on.

Worked very briefly for another recruitment company that I didn't enjoy very much.

Set up my own recruitment consultancy. Just me and some pretty major accounts. Enjoyed being my own boss, having control and seeing and owning every step of the value chain.

Fell out of love with recruitment, decided to study full time web development course at General Assembly Sydney. Learned a whole load of new stuff and really got the bug for learning more in tech.

And there you have it.
